Shmup engine I can use when I'm ready to do an Expanse follow-up!

- Smooth scrolling tiled background built on Ogmo export, uses Canvas to save resources instead of rendering tiles every frame like Jellyfish.
- Enemy behaviors defined in simple Lua table timelines, a lot like my rpg engine's events. 
- Engine should be easily extendable; define new enemy types using simple pre-programmed behaviors in different arrangements.

When I'm ready to turn it into an actual game, I'll add real art, music, sound effects, explosion effects. I'll also build some actual levels, before or after doing a bunch of art depending on my mood.
